        <h2>Population</h2>
        <p>
            Egpyt is the home of more than 100 million people, up by 20 million people since 2000. Of those 100 million people,
          more than 12 million people are squeezed into the capital, Cairo. It ranks 37th in the world for the densest city
          fitting in around 20,000 people per square kilometer. Since the city is populated with people, pollution, traffic, and narrow streets are daily struggles people face
          when commuting to school or their jobs. Luckily, the city has adopted trains, subways, taxis, "tok toks" and even microbuses
          for dropping and picking up hundreds if not thousands of people a day to get from one end of a long street to another
          one.

        <h2>Poverty</h2>
        <p>
          Because of Egypt's rough history with past presidents and foreign affairs, many of the people of the population suffur
          from poverty. It was noted that the for every 3 people, 1 is living in poor conditions. Thus, around a whopping 33.3 millon
          people live in poverty today. This is up from 16.7% since 2000 and 27.8% since 2015. Despite the insane numbers, most people
          make ends meet at the end of the day by selling fruits or vegetables, as well as being doormans to the 15 story high apartment buildings
          protecting the building and responding to orders from apartment renters or buyers in exhchange for a free small room in the basement of the building.

        <h2>Economy</h2>
        <p>
          Despite the unfortunate poverty rates, the Egyptian people see hope in the future to come.
          In the past, Egypt's currency has inflated compared to the USD. For reference, back in 2000
          the Egyptian pound was around 6 pounds per 1 USD. On October 2016, the Egyptian pound
          went up to almost 9 pounds, and one month later in November, shot up to 18 pounds. Since
          2018, the pound has been stable at the 17 mark, but it wasn't until recently in early 2019
          when Egyptians saw the pound decreasing slowly. Today, the pound sits at almost 16 pounds
          per dollar, thus, showing hope for the future of Egypt.
